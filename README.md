I thought the process of calculating each person's income tax can become quite repetitive and time-consuming
so I built a program to do it. All one needs is three numbers: their personal income, tax deductions, and tax credits. 

This program does not take basic personal amount into consideration as that part is dealt by the stage of
tax returns. 

Enjoy!
